Form Validation Project
This project is a simple and responsive form validation system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form ensures that users enter valid information by providing real-time feedback for errors.

Features
Full Name Validation – Ensures users enter their first and last name in the correct format.
Email Validation – Checks if the email follows a valid structure using a regular expression.
Password Validation – Requires the password to be between 4 and 8 characters.
Confirm Password Validation – Ensures the confirm password field matches the entered password.
Instant Error Feedback – Displays error messages in real-time when incorrect information is entered.
Interactive UI – Designed with a modern, user-friendly layout and hover effects.
Technologies Used
HTML5 – For structuring the form.
CSS3 – For styling and layout design.
JavaScript (ES6) – For form validation logic.

How It Works
Users enter their name, email, password, and confirm password.
The JavaScript script validates inputs using regular expressions.
If an error is detected, a red warning message appears below the input field.
If all inputs are valid, the user receives a welcome alert message.
